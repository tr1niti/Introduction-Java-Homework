The .class file has been created using cmd in Windows 7. For doing so, a notepad doc needs to be created first
with the code pasted in it. The file should then be named exactly like the class is named, in my case: SumTwoNumbers.java as
as it also case sensitive. The command prompt should then be started and the directory should be changed to match
the directory in which the file has been saved (using the first command from bellow: cd followed by the path).
 
The command needed to compile the code is javac followed by the name of the file. Another file should be created
in the same directory as the first one. Code in the cmd:
 
cd C:\Users\user\Desktop
 
javac SumTwoNumbers.java
